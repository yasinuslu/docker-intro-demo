# Docker Introduction Demo

You can find following demos in this repository:

## [1-hello-world](./1-hello-world)

A simple container that can serve web content using `serve` package. `nginx` would be a better choice for serving static content but this demo focuses on JavaScript.

## [2-node-server](./2-node-server)

A simple node server that acts as a key-value database and writes data to a json file.

## [3-docker-compose-server-frontend](./3-docker-compose-server-frontend)

Provides a development environment (can be turned into a production environment with few changes) that runs an API, UI and a Database.
